<p>You arrive in a room surrounded by a floor to ceiling mirror that covers the circular room.
You close your eyes immediately because of the intense light filling the room, which seems to
keep in at a toasty 80 degrees as well. You can sense that a being is staring at you, assessing you.</p>
<p>The being of pure white and blue light was emitting a rythmic whirring sound,
like a centrifuge spinning over and over. scrape, whirr, scrape scrape, whirrr.</p>

<p>A melodic, peaceful voice filled the room, 
"I do not recognize you, walker. When the three Sun-Fated daughters spoke of an 
extra-dimensional intrusion, I expected an infiltrator tainted with the signs of
arcane contamination.</p>

<p>Tell me intruder: how have you travelled the planes without
arcane powers of your own?</p>
