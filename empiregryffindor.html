<p>Hmm. There have been no sword users in the Empire in three thousand years, ever since the Paladin colonialists sought a different
world than we did. Only with the combined holy energies of priestkind were the Burning Legion driven off.
The paladins found a long heroic retreat, moving into their original colony ship as they were driven back, but in the end they could not
hold out, as they starved within a cocoon of their peer's invincibility spells.</p>
<p>Our path diverged from the other sword-bearings much further back than that. No, you are either a Paladin, or a demon who
has never tasted arcane magic. Which is it?</p>

<li>[honest]I am a <a href="empirewizard.html">wizard</a>. The sword is not mine, but I can call on it when I need to, for I am Gryffindor!</li>
