<p>"There are few things beyond my ken in all the planarities. 
Alas, this is beyond even the Fountation Council, but I will talk with them.
You may leave by the back entrance to get a head start, but I will not omit
your part in all of this."</p>

<p>"Empress Alliaga dottir Alliaga will hunt you down, before long.
You have become one of the dead Shadow Order despite having not
been aware of their existence five minutes ago. You may be able to convince 
the Purifiers that you are a pretender who stumbled upon some old documents."</p>

<p>The crystalline floor under you tilts and deforms, sending you sliding down 
a chute of pure polished diamond. Your left arm snags the edge of a wall and you go sliding past. It hurts a bit.</p>
<p>You fall into a mound of snow. Brushing yourself off, you turn around, and are struck by the magnificence of the Fountain's abode.
It is a twisting spire of pure diamond.</p>
<p>With your head poking just barely out of the pile of snow, you assess the situation. 
Men and women wearing purple scarves and mittens,
and gleaming silver armor appear to be guarding the outer perimeter of the spire.</p>
<p>You realize you now have the false memories of a shadow priest. A lifetime of preparation, practice and 
battle experience is at your fingertips.</p>

<li>Use <a href="empireshadowhonest1sx.html">major shadow summoning</a>, to create a massive shadow being, which can distract the guards</li>
<li>Use <a href="empireshadowhonest1n.html">nothing</a>. Stand up and brush the snow off your business suit</li>
